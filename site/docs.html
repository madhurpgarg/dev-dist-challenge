        <h2>Descripton of the Solution</h2>
  
        <ul>
        	<li>I chose basic <strong>MVC pattern </strong>to build this application</li>
        	<li>I haven't used any third party library for having MVC in this task, all the <strong>model</strong>, <strong>view</strong> and <strong>controller</strong> are custom created</li>
        	<li>All the modules have single responsibilty like <strong>view</strong> is handling only view rendering, model is to keep the data and respective methods and controller is to handle communication between view and model.</li>
        	<li>As per the mentioned guidelines I cannot use any lib so I have to handle DOM manipulation myself so <strong>Rendered</strong> module is there to handle DOM</li>

        	<li>Using jasmine for writing test cases for the modules, I have written sufficient tests not very extensive </li>

        	<li>Couldn't write test for <strong>StockStream</strong> module because I have use Stomp from global context (as mentioned in guidelines)</li>

        	<li>Use <code>npm test</code> command to run jasmine tests</li>

        	<li>There are frameworks which makes lot of things easier while writting such JavaScript application like AngularJS-1, Angular-2, ReactJS and vuejs etc. Lot of boiler plate code can be removed which is provided by the frameworks.</li>
        	<li>Data binding, template handling, module management so on provided by the framework which I don't need to take care by myself</li>
        	<li>Development time can significantly be removed by using these frameworks</li>
        	<li>Unit testing can also be limited to logic of application. No need to test infra related things</li>
        </ul>
